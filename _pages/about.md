I am a B.S. student in Electrical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
with a concentration in computer systems and microelectronics.

My interests span **computer systems, GPU computing, and hardware–software
co-design**, with an emphasis on performance analysis and system-level
optimization.

I have conducted undergraduate research on **GPU kernel optimization for
large language model inference** and **memory-efficient Transformer systems**,
working on CUDA kernel design, execution pipeline analysis, and performance
benchmarking across compute and memory bottlenecks.
